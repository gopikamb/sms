    6. Components : components file name start with capital letter in src folder
          - Class based Components / Stateful components
            Example: Output Component
          - Functional based / Stateless Components :help for create html components(js files)
               Example: Random Component

    7. Conditional Rendering : it gives o/p rendered by each of conditions
    8. State : Used to store data inside a components and it can be shared with other components as well 
    9. Data sharing from parent to child (only one way binding is possible in react )
        - Using Props
    10. React hooks 
        - useState():to generate state in Functional component
        - useEffect(): allows to perform side effects in your components
        - useParams():return an object of key/valu
        e pairs of the dynamic params from the 
        - createStore(): to create store in redux
        - useDispatch():dispatch actions from an component in react-redux
        - useSelector(): to select update state from store in react-redux
        - useNavigate(): to redirect from one page to another
        - useContext(): share state between deeply nested components

     11. To display an array: map array method
     12. react-router-dom library :To set up route for components
        - route: setup path for each component
        - routes: to hold more route
        - BrowserRouter: to routes all components
        - Link: to navigate from one webpage to another
     13. REDUX : State Management
         - store: to hold all state, where all components can access state 
             - create store.js file in src folder
             - crateStore hook - to create store
             - Provide the store to app: using <Provider> in index.js file
         - action: to define logic needed by component to update state
            - create action folder in src
               - inside action folder , create action js file
               - useDispatch hook : dispatch actions from an component
         -  create constants folder in src
               - inside constatnt folder , create constants js file to hold constants
         - reducer: to update state and adding the update state in store
            - create reducers folder in src
                - inside reducers folder , create reducer js file
     14. createContext: create a context that components can provide or read
